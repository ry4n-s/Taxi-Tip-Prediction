# Taxi Tip Prediction 🚕💡📈

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository showcases a data science project focused on predicting taxi tip amounts in New York City. Utilizing publicly available data provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), this project models tip prediction as a regression problem. The dataset includes a vast array of taxi trip records from June 2020, offering real-world insights into passenger tipping behaviour.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Real-World Dataset**: Analysis based on June 2020 TLC Yellow Taxi Trip records, offering a rich and authentic dataset for model training.
- **Data Preprocessing and Analysis**: Comprehensive preprocessing including outlier removal, feature engineering, and categorical encoding, followed by a detailed exploratory data analysis.
- **Regression Models**: Utilization of Decision Tree Regressors to predict tip amounts, comparing models from Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Models are evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess prediction accuracy.
- **Efficiency Comparison**: Comparison of training times between Scikit-Learn and Snap ML models, providing insights into model efficiency.
